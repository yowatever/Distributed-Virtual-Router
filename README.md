# Distributed Virtual Router

A high-performance distributed virtual router implementation with separate control and data planes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Distributed Architecture** - Scalable control and data plane separation
- **Dynamic Routing** - Real-time route computation and distribution  
- **High Performance** - Optimized packet forwarding engine
- **Modular Design** - Pluggable components for flexibility
