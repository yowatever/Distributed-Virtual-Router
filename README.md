# Distributed Virtual Router

A high-performance distributed virtual router implementation with separate control and data planes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Distributed Architecture** - Scalable control and data plane separation
- **Dynamic Routing** - Real-time route computation and distribution  
- **High Performance** - Optimized packet forwarding engine
- **Modular Design** - Pluggable components for flexibility

## 🏗️ Architecture
Control Plane (Python) → Data Plane (C++) → Network Forwarding
ↆ ↆ
Route Management Packet Processing
